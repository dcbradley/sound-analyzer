# Sound Analyzer

This javascript project is used to demonstrate frequency analysis of
sound in the Ingersoll Physics Museum at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.

It is a modification of
https://github.com/therewasaguy/p5-music-viz/tree/gh-pages/demos/04_fft_freq_spectrum,
adding a view of the time-domain waveform and tweaking a few other
small things.

Use as you wish.
